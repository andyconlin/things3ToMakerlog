# Things 3 --> Makerlog
A tool to log [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) completed items to [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com).

## Intended "versions"
_The amount of these that get completed will depend on its initial use by me and the community; I likely won't do all of them unless it's used or heavily requested._
+ [ ] proof-of-concept simple version
+ [ ] add hard-coded conditions (area/project/tags)
+ [ ] tool with some user-friendly setup (script to get API keys, set params)
+ [ ] get tasks completed since last run (instead of just in the current day)
+ [ ] map to Makerlog product/hashtag (using Things 3 area, project, tag or global setting)
+ [ ] UI to review tasks (with checkboxes) before submitting
+ [ ] ...tbd


## Installation

- [ ] _[internal]_ decide which of these installation methods to create (first)
  - **simple AppleScript or shell script:** installation and trigger method left up to user
    - potentially also include help in installation, whether instructions or an installation script, of sorts
  - **executable:** perhaps simply deployed via Automator. (AppleScript steps, bundled as app)
  - **proper mac app:** would give good intro to developing for macOS, but overkill (at least with current intended feature set)


### Dependencies
**none!** ðŸŽ‰  

...well, that's not entirely true. _Technically_, this requires:
+ [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (_on macOS, specifically_)
+ [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html)
