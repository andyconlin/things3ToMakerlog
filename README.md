# Things 3 --> Makerlog
[Description goes here]
## Installation

- [ ] _[internal]_ decide which of these installation methods to create (first)
  - **simple AppleScript or shell script:** installation and trigger method left up to user
    - potentially also include help in installation, whether instructions or an installation script, of sorts
  - **executable:** perhaps simply deployed via Automator. (AppleScript steps, bundled as app)
  - **proper mac app:** would give good intro to developing for macOS, but overkill (at least with current intended feature set)


### Dependencies
